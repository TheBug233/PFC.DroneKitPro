In my modified version, the dual joystick control and speed adjustment function is added on the basis of the original one.

Yes, after entering this remote control mode, you can freely choose the direction/rotation controlled by the joysticks of the left and right handles respectively.  
Don’t worry, I keep The original single joystick operation mode.  
 
In addition, I also added the function of PC screen synchronization.  
This means you can shoot/record with PDFDrone when you use VR to play VRChat!

Finally, I added a 360 panoramic camera mode for this drone, which can be used to capture panoramic images in VRChat in real time,  
and it is really convenient to control it with a drone!  
In this update, it supports 3D recording! More content about panoramic cameras can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/TheBug233/VRChat360Camera).  
⚠Don't turn on the HUD when using the panorama camera function

Credits and a thank you to you:  
  
Modeling, Setup and additional tools all made by me, PF_Cactus  
  
However. despite having done most if not all of the work myself I must say i couldn't have done it without the community and my friends.  
If it wasn't for my friends and a hand full of people from the VRC Discord for complimenting my work and asking me about it I probably would have never gotten this far.  
I often struggle to keep myself motivated and the hype i got around this project really helped to keep me driven and going to make more.  
  
Sincerely, Thank you all so SO much.  
  
PS. the model was inspired by real drone called the mavic pro which is a real foldable drone made by DJI.
