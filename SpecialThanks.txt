Despite this entire project being made from the ground up Primarily by myself i would still like to extend some
special Thanks to:

- Lyuma
For teaching me the concepts neccecary to make the custom screenjack shader for the camera hud and the ability to take screenshots with the drone.

- DarkKnightXZ
For Beta testing the Installer Script and Drone.

- Rin
For giving me the idea of using the avatar definition to auto place the components instead of needing the user to define them.

- Joshuarox100
For helping me fix a bug with the editor script preventing people from uploading avatars at all.

- Lin & Adeon Writer
With their suggestions and discussions of potential ways to use constraints which led to us figuring out: 
- Linear motion drive constraint setup
- Angular Motion drive constraint setup
And the Smoothed variants of both i derived from those ideas. 
All of which are the core of the entire drone system. 

- Lin
For the world constraint setup that's used to anchor the drone in worldspace.

- Myrkur "The Lady"
For her never ending support an enthusiasm for my project, the consistant bug reports and assistance in helping me fix most if not all issues you encountered.
The 2.0 project would never have even began if it wasn't for her.

There's many more people I'd like to thank but over time i've either forgotten to record their names or forgotten their names as they've come and gone from the discord.
But I couldn't have done it without all the support from the people in my discord server. 

A sincere thank you to each and everyone of you.
