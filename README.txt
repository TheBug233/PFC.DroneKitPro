First off thank you for using my stuff. 
I hope you enjoy my work as worked very hard on making it all.

To install the prefab simply drag it anywhere onto your avatar and the look at the inspector at the right side of your screen. 
It should give you a full guide on how to install the prefab and will even assist you in doing so :)!

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me or join my discord!

Credits and a thank you to you:

Modeling, Setup and additional tools all made by me, PF_Cactus

However. despite having done most if not all of the work myself I must say i couldn't have done it without the community and my friends.
If it wasn't for my friends and a hand full of people from the VRC Discord for complimenting my work and asking me about it I probably would have never gotten this far.
I often struggle to keep myself motivated and the hype i got around this project really helped to keep me driven and going to make more.

Sincerely, Thank you all so SO much. 

PS. the model was inspired by real drone called the mavic pro which is a real foldable drone made by DJI.
