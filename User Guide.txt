****Camera Settings****
[Light] Enables the light on the drone's camera.

[Hud] Opens up the Full Heads up display camera view.

[Zoom] Allows the user to change the FOV of the drone 

****Camera Modes****
The camera comes with 2 options to change it's behaviour and by combining these options the user can achieve 4 different behaviours.

[Headtracking Mode] Headtracking on, Camlock off: Camera Always looks in players current look direction. allowing for full 360 view in any mode at any point.

[Forward Mode] Headtracking off, Camlock on: Camera looks straight forward in drone's forward direction ignoring the player's looking direction completely.

[Pilot Mode] Headtracking on, Camlock on: Camera locks forward but still tracks the user looking up/down. This matches the original 1.x and 2.x behavior. 

[Stationary]Headtracking off, Camlock off: Camera remains in whatever it's current orientation is relative to the drone. Best used in combination with the Gimbal Controls. 

****Drone Dock****
The wrist mounted drone dock functions as a landing pad for the drone as well as featuring a flip screen that shows the drone's pov when not using the Hud.
To open the flip screen use an open hand on either left or right hand while the drone is in flight. 

****Flight Modes****
The drone comes preset with 5 different flight modes for you to use:

[Follow] The drone will stay with your avatar at the given Follow point Facing the same direction as the user.

[Mirror] The drone will position itself infront of the user's face or the custom target and follow them at configurable distance. 
this mode is designed to be used in combination with the locked camera and the HUD to face the user to function as a impromptu pocket mirror.

[Minimap] The Drone will take off and position itself at 50m above the user and show a top down view of the world with a configurable cutoff above the user, allowing it to see through ceilings of buildings to give a proper indoor minimap.

[Stay] The Drone will stay in place unmoving. 

[Remote] The Drone wil enter a state in which the user gets full remote control over the drone allowing for manual control of the drone's flight. see Remote Mode for more detailed instructions. 


****Flight Controls****
In Remote Mode the drone wil give full control to the user about it's movement (note. due to VRChat limitations, the position of the drone is not synchronized between players)

The behaviour of how the drone flies is affected by what camera mode is used as well as certain hand gestures

when piloting the drone it will always see the camera's facing direction as it's forward.
this means that when looking down in headtracking modes 'up' becomes 'forward' for example.

Some Tips and usefull notes:

[Level Flight] when the camera is set to CamLock only the drone wil always fly perfectly level. this is usefull when flying the drone without the hud. 

[Strafe Mode] By using Fingerpoint on either the left or right hand during flight will swap the forward/backward/rotating controls of the remote menu control to a up/down/left/right strafe instead. (relative to the camera)

[Auto alignment] When using remote mode with Headlock cam only the drone wil automatically rotate to match it's facing direction.
